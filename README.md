# Admin dashboard
An admin dashboard template made using grid display
<!-- Live demo [_here_](https://www.example.com). -->

## General Information
<!-- You don't have to answer all the questions - just the ones relevant to your project. -->
The purpose of this project is to make use of all the concepts learnt in TOP grid lessons.
For that matter, the dashboard layout will be composed mostly of grids, although the use of flexbox
might be possible.

As the project is in progress, updates will be made on the subject.
